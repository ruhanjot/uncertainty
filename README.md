# Uncertainty
This program allows you to work with uncertainties and do error propagation. Right now the UI has not been worked on but the class for a value which has an actual value and and uncertainty value exists.

To create a value, use:

`Values(actual, uncertainty)`

All other operations are done by using actual operators.
For example, you can add two values by simply doing `value1 + value2`.
Also numbers and values can be used together in the same equation.
Currently an example is shown in the UI.py file.
